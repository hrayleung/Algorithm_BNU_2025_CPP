# Algorithm_BNU_2025_CPP

This repository contains C++ implementations of algorithm labs and related notes for the Beijing Normal University 2025 Algorithm course. It includes solutions to lab assignments as well as code examples for key algorithmic paradigms.

## Project Structure

### Lab Assignments
- `lab01/`, `lab02/`, `lab03/`, `lab04/`: Course lab assignments containing implementation of various algorithms and data structures.

### Algorithm Paradigms
- `notes_Divide_and_Conquer/`: Examples and exercises using the divide and conquer approach, including:
  - Merge sort for linked lists
  - Binary search tree implementations
  - Hanoi Tower problem
- `notes_DP/`: Dynamic programming examples and exercises, including:
  - Longest palindromic substring
  - Longest increasing subsequence (LIS)
  - Word wrapping problem
- `notes_Greedy/`: Greedy algorithm examples and exercises, including:
  - Container with most water problem
  - Jump game problems
  - Gas station problem

### Build Files
- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake build configuration for the entire project.
- `cmake-build-debug/`: Build directory generated by CLion/CMake (not tracked in repository).

## Prerequisites

- A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- CMake version â‰¥ 3.10.
- (Optional) OpenMP for parallel code examples. On macOS, install via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install libomp
  ```

## Building the Project

Build in a separate directory (e.g., `build/`) to keep the source tree clean:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Executables for all labs and note examples will be generated in the build directory.

## Running Executables

Each lab/problem is compiled into a standalone executable named `labXXXX` or by the example name. Input is read from standard input. For example, to run lab04 problem 03:

```bash
./lab0403 < path/to/input.txt
```

Similarly, you can run examples in the notes directories:

```bash
./LIS
./hanoi_tower
```
